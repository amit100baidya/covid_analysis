# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project explores the global impact of COVID-19 by analyzing data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The aim is to identify trends, correlations, and geographic distribution using visualizations. The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `SNo`: Serial number
- `ObservationDate`: Date of observation
- `Province/State`: Province or state (if applicable)
- `Country/Region`: Country or region
- `Last Update`: Last update timestamp
- `Confirmed`: Total confirmed cases
- `Deaths`: Total deaths
- `Recovered`: Total recoveries

The dataset consists of **306,429 rows** and **8 columns**.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Date Conversion**: The `ObservationDate` column was converted to a datetime format for easier analysis.
2. **Missing Values**: The `Province/State` column, which had a significant number of missing values (78,103), was dropped.
3. **Data Aggregation**: The data was aggregated by `Country/Region` to calculate total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Key Metrics
- **Total Confirmed Cases**: 26,252,051,758
- **Total Recovered**: 15,450,237,912
- **Recovery Rate**: 58.88%
- **Total Deaths**: 624,013,017
- **Death Rate**: 2.37%

### Country-Specific Insights
- The country with the most confirmed cases is the **US** with **6,049,145,667** cases.
- The country with the most deaths is also the **US** with **123,303,762** deaths.
- Total confirmed cases in **China**: **40,822,596**.

## Visualizations
1. **COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Over Time**: A line plot showing the trend of confirmed cases over time.
2. **Total Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by Country**: A bar chart displaying the total confirmed cases for the top 20 countries.
3. **Total Confirmed Deaths by Country**: A bar chart displaying the total deaths for the top 20 countries.
4. **Choropleth Maps**: Interactive maps visualizing confirmed cases and deaths by country.
5. **Trends Over Time**: A line plot showing trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.

## Conclusion
This analysis revealed significant disparities in COVID-19 case distribution across different countries. The correlation between confirmed cases and deaths was high, suggesting a strong relationship between the spread of the virus and its fatal impact.

## Next Steps
Future improvements to this analysis could include:
- Analyzing vaccination data to see its impact on case/death/recovery rates.
- Expanding the dataset to include more demographic variables such as age, gender, etc.
